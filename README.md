# GaCDCourseProject2

To perform the analysis described in the project, you have to execute the script "run_analysis.R" setting "UCI HAR Dataset" folder, from the uncompressed given files, as your working directory. 

The script reads first all the involved files from the folder structure, and afterwards it performs the required transformations, although not in the given order, and creates two datasets, storing the second one in a flat file called "HAR_averages.txt"
